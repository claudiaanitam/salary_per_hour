-- Assuming the SQL will be run on GCP environment

-- PART A: Create a schema and load each CSV file to employees and timesheets tables.
-- Schema employees and load employees CSV file
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employe_id INTEGER

    , salary INTEGER
    , join_date DATE
    , resign_date DATE

FROM FILES (
  format = 'CSV',

-- Schema timesheets and load timesheets CSV file
CREATE TABLE timesheets (
    timesheet_id INTEGER
    , employee_id INTEGER
    , date DATE
    , checkin TIME
    , checkout TIME
);

LOAD DATA OVERWRITE timesheets
FROM FILES (
  format = 'CSV',

-- Schema destination table, assuming the destination table name is fact_detail_salary

    , branch_id INTEGER
    , total_employee INTEGER
    , total_salary INTEGER

-- PART B: Write an SQL script that reads from employees and timesheets tables, transforms,
-- and loads the destination table.
-- The script is expected to run daily in full-snapshot mode, meaning that it will read the
-- whole table and then overwrite the result in the destination table. Note that you donâ€™t
-- have to implement the scheduler, just the script that will be run by the scheduler.
